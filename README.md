# ManagersApplication
 Managers is a PWA Application for high level managers application that implemented with C# .net 6, Visual Studio 2022 and Oracle Database 12C.


## **Requirements:** 
```
1- .Net 6
2- Oracle Database 12C+
```

### Contributing
All work on the C# and Visual Studio compiler happens directly on GitHub. Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

### How it works:
```
this Application is working with Oracle Database and Store Procedures(ORM).
So we decided to write a useful app that managers have the ability to do high level jobs when ever they are not in Office.
```
